        We are surrounded by microphones in our phones, tablets, laptops, televisions, and other "Internet of Things" devices. These devices can listen to and transmit our conversations at any time.\n\n
        Identifying each nearby microphone and getting to a safe distance just to have a private conversation is not always possible. Instead, SpeakFree produces loud noises in the range of human conversation to drown out your voice and make nearby microphones less effective.\n\n
        To use the app, simply press the play button and turn up the volume as loud as is comfortable. The static must be much louder than your conversation to drown out your voice. Speak quietly.\n\n
        This app is not guaranteed to make your conversation private; too low a volume, too close a microphone, or too skilled a sound engineer can still pick out your voice.\n\n
        Further tips for keeping your conversation private are provided on the main screen.
